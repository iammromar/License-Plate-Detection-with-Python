# License Plate Detection with Python

This repository provides a Python implementation for detecting and recognizing license plates in images using computer vision techniques. The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can accurately locate and extract license plate information from car images.

## Features

- License plate detection: The system can detect the presence of license plates in images by analyzing their visual characteristics such as color, shape, and texture.
- License plate recognition: Once the license plate is detected, the system employs optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract the alphanumeric characters from the plate.

## Installation

To use this license plate detection system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-detection.git
cd license-plate-detection
```

2. Set up the Python environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the necessary pre-trained models or weights for license plate detection and recognition. You can find these models in the "models" directory of the repository.

4. Run the main script with an input image:

```bash
python detect_license_plate.py --image input_image.jpg
```

The detected license plates will be highlighted in the output image, and the recognized characters will be printed in the console.

## Usage

To use the license plate detection system in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

2. Load the license plate detection model:

```python
plate_model = cv2.dnn.readNet("models/license_plate_detection.weights", "models/license_plate_detection.cfg")
```

3. Preprocess the input image:

```python
image = cv2.imread("input_image.jpg")
resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (416, 416))
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(resized_image, 1 / 255.0, (416, 416), swapRB=True, crop=False)
```

4. Perform license plate detection:

```python
plate_model.setInput(blob)
detections = plate_model.forward()
```

5. Extract license plate information from the detections:

```python
for detection in detections:
    confidence = detection[5]
    if confidence > 0.5:  # Adjust the confidence threshold as needed
        box = detection[0:4] * np.array([image.shape[1], image.shape[0], image.shape[1], image.shape[0]])
        (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) = box.astype("int")
        plate = image[start_y:end_y, start_x:end_x]
        # Further processing or OCR can be applied to extract characters from the license plate
```

6. Perform license plate recognition (OCR) on the extracted plates using a suitable OCR library or algorithm.
